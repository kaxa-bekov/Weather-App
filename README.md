This is a pet project of mine. I practised using multiple APIs and displaying the information. Also learned a lot about so called 'tabbed' layouts.
I used Weather API, Geocoding API, Google Geocoding,reverse geocoding, Google Time Zone APi, Google Map API and Google Places API.
I also learned a lot about CSS styling, starting with using all kind of selectors and their combination to flexbox and grid layouts, fonts, variables and most importantly responsive design and @ rules.
I practised my HTML knowledge.
I practised Java Script built in functionality such as Dates, Promises, async/await. Also got to use browser API, HTML5 API. Worked a lot with Arrays, complex loops, adding and deleting items in arrays. Also worked with JS objects, created them and used them to pass along needed information.
I finally got to use JSON, all of the API responses were in JSON form and had to pick certain data that I needed and save it to my custom objects.
Design idea was taken from https://app.uizard.io/templates/Ewg08vdL3KCPwevXrX3B/fullscreen.
